# blackjack-agent
An agent for playing blackjack built using Stochastic Q-Learning.


This is my attempt at creating a blackjack agent using Stochastic Q-Learning. This project was implemented for ESC 704: Stochastic Systems at CSU for the mini-project assignment of the course.


I previously built a similar (but not stochastic) Texas Hold-Em Q-Learning agent along with three of my colleagues for our class project for AI while I was BW. This agent will be significantly more complex and will employ techniques from relevant modern research papers regarding modelling how people play blackjack.
